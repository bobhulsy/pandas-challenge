PyCity Schools Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of school performance based on a variety of factors such as budget, school size, and type of school (charter vs district).

## Key Findings

1. Schools with larger budgets did not necessarily yield better test results. In fact, schools that spent more per student (645-675) underperformed compared to those with smaller budgets (585 per student).

2. Smaller and medium-sized schools significantly outperformed larger schools in terms of students passing math (89-91% passing rate for smaller schools vs 67% for larger schools).

3. Charter schools outperformed public district schools across all metrics. However, it's important to note that this could be influenced by various factors. For instance, charter schools typically have smaller student populations, which might contribute to their higher performance.

## Further Analysis

Further analysis is required to determine the exact cause of the discrepancies observed. Factors such as school practices or the smaller student populations typically served by charter schools could be influencing these results.
